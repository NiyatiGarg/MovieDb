# 🎬 MovieDB Web Application

A responsive and feature-rich movie browser app built using **React.js** and the **TMDB API**. This project was developed as part of an interview selection round to demonstrate my proficiency in React, state management using Redux, and API integration.

Explore popular, top-rated, and upcoming movies, perform searches, and view detailed movie information — all in one clean, user-friendly interface.
